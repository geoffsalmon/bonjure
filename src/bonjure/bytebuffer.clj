(ns bonjure.bytebuffer
  "Library for simplifying working with java.nio.ByteBuffer
objects.

The aim here is not to provide a clojure function wrapping every Java
method. Instead the functions here are added to be more convenient or
more clojurey.

Notable additions are

1. Handles signed and unsigned values pleasently. Usually reading or
writing unsigned fields with ByteBuffers is a pain because Java
doesn't have unsigned primitives. The unsigned take-* functions here
actually return a type that is one step larger than the requested
type, ex. take-ushort returns an int, and take-uint returns a
bigint. The larger types are big enough to handle the entire unsigned
range of the smaller type. Similarly, although there are not separate
signed and unsigned version, the put-* functions will accept any
number type and truncate it so positive and negative numbers can be
stored.

NOTE: Add an overflow check to avoid overflows in put-* functions?

2. Provides pack and unpack functions inspired by Python's struct
module. Use simple format strings, similar to printf's, to define how
fields are layed out in the buffer.

Usage:

(pack buff \"isbb\" 123 43 23 3) ; puts an int, a short and two bytes into buff
(.flip buff) ; assuming nothing else was written to the buffer
(unpack buff \"isbb\") => (123 43 24 3)

3. Provides pack-bits and unpack-bits functions for working with bit
fields within numbers. These are useful for pulling apart flag fields
in packets.

I'm considering removing both this and the *byte-buffer* var and
simplifying all of the put-* and take-* fns. Originally this was added
avoid the redundancy of specifying the buffer multiple times in a let
when taking many fields, but now the same thing can be down even
easier with the pack function. Still undecided though.
